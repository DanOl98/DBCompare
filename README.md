# DBCompare
DB Compare is used to compare two instance of SQL Server database and view a report of any schema differences. DB Compare was originally a sample of DataTier.Net and uses the same class SQLDatabaseConnector.cs to read the database schema.


[This is the most recent video on YouTube:](https://youtu.be/13HipAOyAqU)

The video lists the URL incorrectly, now DB Compare is in its own repo:
https://github.com/DataJuggler/DBCompare

The main engine of DB Compare and DataTier.Net is a class library called DataJuggler.Net.

For any projects that need to read the database schema of a SQL Server database, DataJuggler.Net is available as a Nuget Package:

Install-Package DataJuggler.Net -Version 5.4.2

Or install the package using NuGet Package Manager (which is what I do).

I am building a website this weekend, so I will have an install version available soon (I took the install out of the repo).
