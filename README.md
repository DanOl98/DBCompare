# DBCompare
DB Compare is used to compare two instances of a SQL Server database and view a report of any schema differences. DB Compare was originally a sample of DataTier.Net and uses the same class SQLDatabaseConnector.cs to read the database schema.

This project now has Git Hug Pages setup. Book mark this and I will try and keep it up to date with the latest news:

<a href='https://datajuggler.github.io/DBCompare/'>DB Compare Home - Git Hub Pages</a>

The video lists the URL incorrectly, now DB Compare is in its own repo:

<a href='https://github.com/DataJuggler/DBCompare'>DB Compare on Git Hub<a/>

The main engine of DB Compare and the project DataTier.Net is a class library called DataJuggler.Net.

For any projects that need to read the database schema of a SQL Server database, DataJuggler.Net is available as a Nuget Package:

Install-Package DataJuggler.Net -Version 5.4.2

Or install the package using NuGet Package Manager (which is what I do).

I am building a website this weekend, so I will have an install version available soon (I took the install out of the repo).
